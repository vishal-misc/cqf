    "Those of us old enough (and fortunate) to remember, will recall the BBC comedy sketch series – Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Televised during the late 60s and early 70s, it was conceived, written and performed by the comedy geniuses collectively known as Monty Python (or simply The Pythons). These intellectual masters of humour were predominantly Oxbridge graduates. Fast forward two decades, and we see that this comedy series became the inspiration for the name of a new programming language! \n",

    "This is a programming course in the use of Python as a scientific computing language for computational finance applications; as part of the Oxford MSc. It is intended for those who are new to  programming in Python. As well as an informal lecture style delivery we will also be doing exercises. We don’t want to be computer scientists or developers. Our goal is solve pricing problems numerically; handle/analyse data and plot data, using Python – simple and enjoyable! Where possible we use as much of the built-in functionality as possible – remember this is not a computer science course. The notes also form part of a textbook which is being prepared for Wiley Finance.\n",

    "Python is a general-purpose dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) programming language. This means we can type statements into the interpreter and they are executed immediately. In contrast, languages such as Java and C are compiled languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed for two reasons - so code written in Python would be easy for humans to read; and to minimize the amount of time required to write code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short; well structured; readable and flexible, and one loses the compile-time type checking of the source code. The philosophy is “we code what we think”. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs. An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Science has traditionally consisted of two major disciplines, theory and experimentation. In the last several decades a third important and exciting component has emerged, i.e. scientific computing. Scientific computing acts as an intersection of the former two areas of science. It is often closely related to theory, but it also has many characteristics in common with experimental work. It is therefore often viewed as a third branch of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most areas of science, computation is an invaluable complement to both experiments and theory. Vast majority of both experimental and theoretical research involve some numerical calculations, simulations or computer modelling. In many studies, pure theory alone is insufficient in validating or demonstrating results. On the other hand, experimentation as a sole means of conducting an investigation may lack the scientific rigour necessary to hold up to scrutiny. Experimental work may not be possible or may prove too costly. \n"

These libraries and tools generally have to be imported when needed (e.g. a plotting library) or have to be started as a separate system process (e.g., a Python development environment). Those of you familiar with (say) Matlab and R will know that they come with a pre-bundled set of modules of various aspects of scientific computing. Importing means making a library available to the current namespace and the current Python interpreter process. The reserved word import is used; just as in C++ where the prefix #include is the syntax for importing a library.  \n",

    "Python itself already comes with a large set of libraries that enhance the basic interpreter in different directions. For example, basic mathematical calculations; I/O; string manipulation, can be done without any importing, while operations requiring (say) more complex mathematical functions need to be imported through the math library. When a Python program starts it only has access to a basic functions and classes.\n",

    "## Preliminary Remarks about Program Style\n",
    "**Whitespace** is the name given to spaces, tabs and indents. Whitespace is also used to define blocks (in C++) using indentation. This promotes readability. For certain code it is necessary, and we will discuss later in the section on user-defined functions.The end of a line is unimportant in Python, as it almost completely ignores whitespace. The compounding formula script above was expressed in two ways and both gave the same result. However the lack of program comments, spaces, new lines and indentation makes this program quite unacceptable, and with larger programs becomes very difficult to read. Whilst there is much more to developing a good programming style than learning to lay out programs properly, this is nevertheless a good start. \n",
    "Be consistent with your program layout, and make sure the indentation and spacing reflects the logical structure of your program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a good idea to choose meaningful names for variables. Remember that your code might need modification by other programmers at a later date. Even if a programmer refers to their own code (say) a year later, without proper documentation and use of meaningful variable names, they will need to spend considerable time refreshing them self on the various parts of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some languages, whitespace is significant in Python.  In Python a block is delimited by indentation. There's no brackets or parentheses to match up just indents. "

    "There are numerous exercises in this chapter to help review the first four chapters. Consider using any of the libraries referenced earlier including https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html  \n",
    "1. Write a short program that displays your name and complete mailing address formatted in the manner that you would usually see it on the outside of an envelope. Your program should take input from the user.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the following expressions: $7-15$; $3^7+16/3$; $\\sqrt{12}-e^{4}$ using a line of syntax for each.\n",
    "3. Write Python code to calculate the expression $\\sqrt{(4x^{2}+\\pi) }x^{5}\\log _{4}x$, for a choice of $x>0$.\n",
    "4. Calculate $\\sin\\left \\{\\dfrac{1}{x^2+1}\\right\\}$ for $x=3.3$.\n",
    "5. The normal body temperature of a human is 37 degrees Celsius $C$. Convert this to degrees Fahrenheit $F$ using the expression $$C=\\dfrac{5}{9}(F-32)$$.\n",
    "6. The volume of blood in a human body is approximately 4.7 to 5.5 litres. Convert this range to both pints and gallons.\n",
    "7. Create a program that inputs from the user, two integers, $a$ and $b$. Compute and display:\n",
    "> * The sum of $a$ and $b$\n",
    "> * The difference when $b$ is subtracted from $a$\n",
    "> * The absolute value of the difference\n",
    "> * The product of $a$ and $b$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The quotient when $a$ is divided by $b$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* The remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* The result $\\log_{10}a$\n",
    "8. Write a short program to read in a users weight in kg. Then convert this amount into pounds and stones. **Hint:** 2.2lbs$\\equiv$1kg and 1 stone is 14lbs. \n",
    "9. A clinic currently measures the heights of patients in centimetres. You have been asked to assist them by writing a short Python program that reads in this information, to convert and display into feet and inches. **Hint:** One foot is 12 inches. One inch is 2.54 centimeters.\n",
    "10. The volume of a cylinder can be obtained by multiplying the area of its circular base by its height. Write a program that reads the radius of the cylinder, along with its height, from the user and computes its volume. Display the result rounded to two decimal places. The volume $V$ of a circular cone, radius $r$, and vertical height (from base to vertex) $h$ is given by $V=\\pi$$r^2{\\dfrac{h}{3}}$\n",
    "11. 180 degrees is equivalent to $\\pi$ radians. Write a program to convert degrees to radians. The user should input the degrees for conversion.\n",
    "12. This question involves using Python syntax to perform arithmetic on complex numbers. Let $z_{1}=3+5i$; $z_{2}=7-i$; $z_{3}=3-2i$ and $z_{4}=4+5i$. \n",
    ">* Calculate $z_{1}\\pm{z_{2}}$; $z_{3}{z_{4}}$; $\\dfrac{z_{3}}{z_{4}}$. What are the real and imaginary parts of $\\dfrac{z_{3}}{z_{4}}$\n",
    ">* Repeat the above by expressing each complex number in polar form, to validate your answers.\n",
    "13. You have just opened a new savings account. The risk-free interest rate is 3.6%  per annum compounded discretely. Write a program that begins by reading the amount of money deposited into the account from the user, as well as the rate of interest. Then your program should compute and display the amount in the savings account after 1, 2, and 3 years. Display each amount so that it is rounded to 2 decimal places. Repeat this exercise for the case where the risk free rate is continuously compounded. \n",
    "14. This problem is on discounting. Calculate the current worth of £5000 in 3 years time if the interest rate is 6% continuously compounded. "
